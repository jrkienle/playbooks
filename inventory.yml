# This file tells Ansible to run all of our playbooks on the local machine. This needs to be
# explicitly configured since Ansible is technically designed to be ran over a network of
# multiple machines (i.e. setting up a fleet of AWS EC2 instances during deployments). The "all"
# key at the top of the file is important as that's the name of the network group. You'll see
# that in-use in the 3rd line of each playbook
